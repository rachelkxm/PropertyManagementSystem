Property Management System including three parts: user login/register, user profile(personal information, favorite list, tour list) and property list.
Login/register is required to use the system.
Every one can post/edit/delete properties(house, condo, apartment, townhouse).
Also, everyone can view others' posts and add them into favorite list or make a tour for a property and all the visited properties will show in your personal settings.
The system also support sort. The property type is sorted by default as a category and you sort the properties by zip code, either in ascending or descending order.
You can also search a property by zip code, location, price and any attribute of a property.
The status of a property includes "on sale", "pending", "sold", "out of market".
currently it only support the transition from on sale to pending when user make a tour visite.
(in actual situations, there are more steps from on sale to pending)
