# Saving your project for future personal use and/or showing to prospective employers

The github repos for this class will be replaced for the next class begins.  You've done a lot of hard work and may want to keep the results of your efforts.  
First, even if you do absolutely nothing, you already have a copy of the repository on your machine - every time you do a `git commit`, you are adding your changes to a local copy of every bit of code (including the history of changes).  i
Every time you do a `git pull` you are copying any changes made to the repo on github to that local repository.

So if you are unable to follow these instructions before the github repo is gone, you can create a new repo (on github or a competitor) using the data in your local repo (follow the instructions those sites give you for using an existing repo when you create a new repo), or you can create other local repositories on your current machine or other machines you have access to.


## About Public and Private Repos
Regardless of how you get the code anywhere, make sure you understand public/private repos.  Your class repositories have been private, with only you and I able to see them and update them.  A new repository you create on a site like github can be private (github.com charges for private repos, other sites usually have similar policies), and you can set who can see them and who can update them, or they can be public, which means you can still control who can update them, but anyone can see them.  To show off your code you'll want to have it in a public repo, for personal development you should choose whichever option you prefer.
