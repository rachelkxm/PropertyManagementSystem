# Initial Server Side Setup

There are some tasks needed for your application to work that only have to happen once, so while you can build those steps into the application if you wanted, it's probably not an efficient use of time, particularly on this project. 

Instead, you can take care of these tasks manually, sending fetch() requests from a browser console to the server-side API.  

This is a list of some of those tasks and what you would do for them.  Not all projects will need each step, and some of the steps depend on how your application data model is structured.

## TODO: Creating your first user
## TODO: Adding any additional admin users
## TODO: Creating any mandatory topics
## TODO: Populating any base data
## TODO: Cleaning up your data if you change your data model (or just mess up)
