# Project Timeline and Schedule

Tue Aug 1: In class: I want to hear your ideas for what "inventory" you plan to track for the project, and what the status will reflect (For example, is a library book checked out)
    This is advisory, to make sure the ideas don't contain complications and that people aren't working on the same concept.

Tue Aug 8: I will be asking for a few volunteers to present their projects at this class (showing the app, not the code)
    Demos of incomplete projects are fine, this is to talk about application behavior

Fri Aug 11: Project deadline is midnight Friday Aug 11 (see below)
                    
    I will be responding to projects as they come in (including before Aug 11) and revisions to address issues will be taken without penalty until midnight Friday Aug 18 as long as you submitted something real by the project deadline, but I advise everyone to submit as early as possible so they have a chance to react to any feedback and correct any problems.  If someone is fast enough, they might even have several rounds of corrections that might improve their grade significantly.

Fri Aug 18: Final absolute no-chance-to-change-anything deadline is midnight Fri Aug 18.
