# Using git and github

*git* is one of the most common source control systems in current use.  (meaning it tracks your code, including changes, across multiple developers).   

*github* is a popular website that hosts git repositories.  

For modern developers, particularly but not limited to Javascript devs, it is highly recommended that you have at least a passing acquaintance with git, github, and the process of submitting changes to both a local repository and remote one.

In terms of gaining employment, having a github account that has some of your work publically visible is a great boon.  I recommend putting some work out there and including the github url on your resume.
